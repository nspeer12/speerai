            <p>March 2022 - Present | West Palm Beach, Florida</p>

            <p><strong>Deploying Robots:</strong> I lead hardware and software installations, programming autonomous
              missions for Boston Dynamics robots in industrial environments. My role involves collaboration across
              teams, clients, and partner companies to ensure successful project outcomes.</p>

            <p><strong>Full-Stack Development:</strong> I develop full-stack web applications using Python and Vue.js to
              create web applications for computer vision applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Rapid Prototyping:</strong> I am able to quickly prototype new software tools and automation
              features to solve complex problems for customers and internal teams, saving over 3,000 hours of customer
              support time.</p>

            <p><strong>Product Development:</strong> I empathize with customers to understand their challenges, plan with
              teams to align product roadmap and business strategy, and design products to build long-term solutions
              that unlock value and ROI for customers.</p>

            <p><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> My role involves expertly troubleshooting complex technical issues on
              robots, navigating fluently through multiple operating systems, networking
              infrastructure, and programming languages to minimize downtime and ensure smooth operation.</p>

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <h2>AI Researcher at University of Florida</h2>
        <p>October 2021 - January 2022 | Gainesville, Florida</p>

        <p><strong>Collaboration:</strong> I worked with the Advanced Physics Research Group at University of Florida to
          develop and deploy machine learning models for nuclear fusion simulations.</p>

        <p><strong>Supercomputing:</strong> I configured Nvidia A100 clusters to leverage massive
          amounts of compute power to train machine learning models on large physics datasets.</p>

        <p><strong>MLOps:</strong> I developed an MLOps pipeline to automate model training,
          validation, and tune hyperparameters of ML models. This enabled physics researchers to apply good-practice ML
          techniques to various problems within their field.</p>
